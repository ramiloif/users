# Users

## stracture: 
/server - nestjs server
/client - react client
/e2e - pupeteer e2e test


What can be improved: 
1. DB connection from environment variable nest js props...
2. spesific error code response in case email alreadu exist for example 409
3. dont refethch all users on any user create
4. add some report to pupeteer test and not just exit code
